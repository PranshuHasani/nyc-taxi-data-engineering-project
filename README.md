# nyc-taxi-data-engineering-project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built on the Azure ecosystem. The pipeline ingests raw data from an API source, processes it using Azure Data Factory (ADF), transforms it using Databricks (PySpark), and stores it efficiently in Azure Data Lake Gen2 using the Medallion Architecture — Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
